# nl_online
This repository will always keep the .psc sources for the following libraries up to date:

## Current Papyrus Libraries
* [SKSE64](https://github.com/ianpatt/skse64)
* [JContainers (64-bit)](https://github.com/ryobg/JContainers)
* SSE Base scripts

## Purpose
I created this repository to be used alongside [Pyro](https://github.com/fireundubh/pyro/tree/master/pyro), as some papyrus libraries are not available online.

## Licenses
All files in this repository are released under the [GPL-3.0 License](LICENSE) with the following exceptions:

* A file specifies another license in the header
* A folder contains another LICENSE file, in which case that license applies to files and subfolders in the same folder
