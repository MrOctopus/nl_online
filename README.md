# nl_online
This repository functions as a common repository for popular .psc sources, some of which are automatically updated.

## Always up-to-date libraries
* [SKSE64](https://github.com/ianpatt/skse64)
* [JContainers (64-bit)](https://github.com/ryobg/JContainers)

## Manually updated libraries
* [SkyUI](https://github.com/schlangster/skyui)
* SSE Base scripts

## Purpose
I created this repository to be used alongside [Pyro](https://github.com/fireundubh/pyro/tree/master/pyro), as some papyrus libraries are not available online.
